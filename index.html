       First week: 8/18-8/20: We introduced ourselves and started coding this website.
       <br>
       Second week: 8/22-8/26: We continued coding this website. We also went over the design process and looked at some examples. Loved brainstorming ideas.
       <br>
       Third week: 9/5-9/9: Amelia and I worked on a boat for our Wednesday Challenge. We started our first lab. The picture is the boat I built in 20 minutes.

       Fourth week: 9/12-9/18: Started our Rube Goldberg Machine project. We had to included at least two simple machines. I am planning on using a pulley, inclined plane, and wedge.

       Fifth week: 9/19-9/25: Started working on Rube Goldberg Machine. I am using cardboard, wood, a toy car, a baseball, some string, rubberbands, and tape to put together my project.
       <br>
       Sixth week: 9/26-10/2: Finished Rube Goldberg Machine. I'm happy wtih the result but I wish it was more consistent. It took about three trys for it to work properly.

       Seventh week: 10/3-10/9: Researched Design Project a little bit and had an introduction to electronics. 
       <br> 
       Eigth week: 10/10-10/16: Continued electric engineering course and made some cool ciruits. I lights to turn on and off at random intervals also.
