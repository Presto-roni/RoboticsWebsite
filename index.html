       <br>
       Second week: 8/22-8/26: We continued coding this website. We also went over the design process and looked at some examples. Loved brainstorming ideas.

       Fifth week: 9/19-9/25: Started working on Rube Goldberg Machine. I am using cardboard, wood, a toy car, a baseball, some string, rubberbands, and tape to put together my project.

       Sixth week: 9/26-10/2: Finished Rube Goldberg Machine. I'm happy wtih the result but I wish it was more consistent. It took about three trys for it to work properly.
